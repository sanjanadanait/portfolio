        <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          Learning Management System platforms have been in use since quite some time now, but due to recent conditions
          and increase in the use and feasibility of technology, the use of such platforms has rapidly increased.
          Since the COVID 19 pandemic hit the world, and everyone moved to the WFH culture, students and teachers of
          Universities and schools have also been affected a lot. Online schooling has become the new norm, and
          there are not many services catering to these users to make the online learning experience easier. Over 90%
          of the teachers adopted WhatsApp as the primary mode of conducting assignments/homework. Problem
          with the existing products:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overall shoddy experience</li>
          <li>Creating assignments is extremely difficult</li>
          <li>Conduct handwritten assignments (Google classroom/MS Teams) is a painful experience</li>
          <li>Not mobile first</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>
          I began my research for this challenge by browsing through different Ed tech apps and services already in the market.
          I analysed some of the features available on apps and websites catering to students and teacher, and
          also went through the reviews of these apps to understand user’s pain points.
          Through my research, I understood that the existing apps offer only few features and also lack a user friendly interface.
          There is no comprehensive one stop application for students and teachers to incorporate online lectures,
          video tutorials, time tables, homework, assignment submissions, grading, etc.<br><br></p>

        <h2>EXISTING APPS SURVEY</h2>
        <p>I went through the interfaces of Google Classroom and Canvas to understand how they’re structured
          and how they function. Reviews highlighting common pain points:</p>

        <p>Why Zoom calls/ Skype/ Google Meets don’t fulfill the student and teacher needs?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Though it provides one on one interactions, it does more harm than good. There have been cases and news all
            around where students were caught doing mischievous things which creates problems for teachers who’re new to
            this online teaching experience.</li>
          <li>There is no feature where students can see the recordings of videos if they missed any lecture or couldn’t
            understand in one go. Having recordings can help teachers to plan their future lectures, and can help students
            who miss lectures due to electricity issues, internet connectivity problems or any other personal problems.</li>
          <li>There is no feature in zoom calls or skype calls where teachers can send assignments to students and students
            can submit them.</li>
          <li>The teacher has to take attendance by calling out names and it can take up a lot of time based on the number of
            students present or due to internet connectivity issues.</li>
          <li>Students lack classroom like environment (which is a must for primary section kids as they need more attention
            and discipline).</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- User Interviews -->

      <div id="understanding-users">
        <hr class="separator">
        <h2>UNDERSTANDING USERS</h2>
        <p>
          The main aim of conducting interviews of the users was to find out the problems that they are facing
          currently, the frustrations and the needs of the user. I interviewed 22 students and 7 teachers to find
          out how are they are dealing with online studies currently, what apps are being used by the teachers to
          assign them work, how they manage group work, etc..<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Interviewees:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>University students</li>
          <li>School students</li>
          <li>Teachers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goal of the interview:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To understand the major problems students and teachers are facing with online education.</li>
          <li>To know which apps/ platforms are they currently using for online education.</li>
          <li>Are students always able to attend lectures on time/ does internet connectivity affect attendance?</li>
          <li>Do students understand easily though online lectures? If not, how do they solve their doubts?</li>
          <li>How do teachers assign group projects, individual homework and assignments?</li>
          <li>What format are these projects and assignments submitted in? Are they handwritten or are they pdf/ word documents?</li>
          <li>How do teachers grade these submissions and give corrections?</li>
          <li>How are online tests/ quizzes conducted?</li>
          <li>What features do they think can improve the online learning experience?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Student Interviews Insights:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Many students find it hard to understand difficult concepts of subjects like Physics and Maths through online lectures.
            They mentioned how it used to be easier to ask doubts during lectures in school but on online videos it is a hassle.</li>
          <li>Some students are also hesitant to speak up and ask doubts in the presence of the entire class, and used to prefer asking
            doubts to teachers personally in school. Now, they don’t understand whether it’s okay to message their teachers on
            WhatsApp for any doubts and clarifications. Sometimes they also find it difficult to explain their doubts through text.</li>
          <li>Different subjects have different groups assigned for projects and this makes the communication and file sharing with groups
            very complicated. Groups have to be made on WhatsApp for communication, as well as a google drive folder to share the work files.</li>
          <li>Different teachers give different formats for assignments/ homework submissions. Sometimes its handwritten work that needs to
            be uploaded in a jpeg format, while sometimes they’re pdfs which are difficult to work and navigate around.</li>
          <li>All communication regarding lecture timings and assignment submissions happens via Whatsapp and hence it’s difficult to keep
            track of all subject lectures and due dates for homework.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Teacher Interviews Insights:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is hard for teachers to explain difficult concepts of subjects like Physics and Maths, or to explain things like chemical
            reactions, through online lectures. Drawing diagrams on a board and showing students via online lectures does not work well
            since video qualities are different for people with different internet connectivity.</li>
          <li>Uploading notes, material explained in the lectures has to be done via google drive, or they have to make a separate
            presentation and share on WhatsApp, which is an added task.</li>
          <li>Students are hesitant to speak up and ask doubts in the presence of the entire class, and end up messaging on WhatsApp
            for any doubts and clarifications which is inconvenient for many teachers.</li>
          <li>If a student does want to ask doubts during the lecture, teachers cannot see each student’s camera so they don’t understand
            whether anybody wants to ask questions.</li>
          <li>Different subjects have different groups assigned for projects and this makes the communication and file sharing with
            groups very complicated. Groups have to be made on WhatsApp for communication, as well as a google drive folders to share the work files.</li>
          <li>It’s difficult for teachers to give corrections on student’s assignments. They have to write/ solve the corrections and upload it
            as separate files for the students. This makes the whole process very time consuming.</li>
          <li>All communication regarding lecture timings and assignment submissions happens via Whatsapp and hence it’s difficult to keep
            track of all subject lectures and due dates for homework.</li>
          <li>Taking attendance during online lectures is a very time consuming task. It’s also hard to understand if anybody is being mischievous
            or putting proxy for another student.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personas:</h2>

        <p>Based on these insights, I created user personas to give a narrative to these user interviews and reviews. This helped me
          in better understanding the type of users the app caters to, and to identify pain points easily.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>User Flows:</h2>
        <p>I created user flows to understand and show the various scenarios that could come up for the students on the app. It helped
          me to design the app navigation and organize information in a way that is easily searchable and simple to use for the students
          to achieve their goals. The user flow demonstrates the step by step actions taken by the users to accomplish different tasks
          while using the app. <br><br> </p>

            <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
            <p>Analysing an app that I have been using for years, from a design perspective, identifying the problems and, coming up
              with solutions to improve its user experience was a very satisfying and enriching experience.</p> <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Throughout this project, my research led me to a lot of reading about the importance of ergonomics
                in UX design. I learned many new principles and gained valuable knowledge that I can apply in my future work.<br></li>
              <li>One challenging part of this case study was to design in a way so that the user is not overwhelmed with such a large amount
                of information that the app offers. The most significant changes I made for this are: <br>
                I changed the existing sliding menu display, introduced white space which helps balance the the design elements on
                the screen compared to the current black screen design, and I re-organized the content in a structured and simple way.</li>
